##Student Loan by State - Interactive Map Using D3

If you want to play around with the map, you can visit it [here](http://jpoles1.github.io/earnest/).

If you want to take a look at the code, most of the important stuff is in these files:

- clean.py - python script for cleaning the data downloaded in CSV format
- index.html - html file containing all of the html and javascript code needed to create the map
